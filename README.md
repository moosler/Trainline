## Game description

In this game your task is to drive an increasing number of trains ðŸš† to their respective stations.
The trains are color-coded and have to travel to the corresponding station with the same color.

Starting with the sixth level, all levels are created by a random generator. Therefore the level of difficulty does not increase with the progress but is pure randomness.

## How to play

Some rails consist of switches that can be adjusted by clicking on them.
By setting the switches in the right position you can control the path of the train

## Map Editor

The Map editor is currently still in the beta phase.
The rails cannot be rotated at the moment.

## Random Map Generator

Any sequence of numbers can be entered in the upper text field.
This sequence of numbers is used to create a random rail network
